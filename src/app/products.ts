      description: "The purpose of this paper is to create and analyze, using MATLAB, the properties of a point-to-point communication system when subjected to negative phenomena, such as the effects of Doppler frequency and time-delay spreading. Our system will employ QPSK as the modulation scheme, and will utilize LDPC, based on the DVB-S2 standard, in the coding operation for linear error correction. Moreover, to reduce the fading and the attenuation of transmitted signals within our system, we will implement OFDM, splitting our digital data onto multiple sub-carrier frequencies. Consequently, we will demonstrate the process for determining the number of subcarriers for our OFDM system, as well as the size of the corresponding Fast Fourier transform. We then evaluate our system by illustrating the bit-error rate with and without the employment of OFDM. Finally, we take an alternative approach through implementing 16-QAM as the modulation scheme and compare the acquired results.",
